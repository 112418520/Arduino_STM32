Arduino STM32
=============

###Important. This repo is not compatible with Adrduino IDE 1.6.2 or newer

The Arduino IDE team made a major change, to the compilor and other files, they also don't install the ARM compilor by default. (see https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/issues/39)

Please use Arduino IDE V 1.6.1 until this whole mess with the IDE is resolved

Hardware files to support STM32 based boards on Arduino version 1.5.x to version 1.6.1 , including LeafLabs Maple, and Maple mini, and other generic STM32F103 boards

Please read the wiki  https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/wiki for full details

Based on https://github.com/bobc/maple-asp, which is in turn based on LibMaple by Leaflabs
